# Deploying an application includes the following steps:
	1- Determining what cloud resources are needed.
	2- Preparing the application code for production and deploying it for the first time.
	3- Creating a deployment process that you will automate using a CI/CD Pipeline.
	4- Documenting your process and iterating on it.

* DevOps: A collection of techniques trying to bridge the gap between development and operations.

* CI (Continous Integration): handles the integration of new code into the main code-base in a consistent and repeatable way.
	- everyone merging code changes to a central repository multiple times a day

* Pipeline: A series of automated steps (Command-Line Interface commands) --> grouped in -> script_files
	that simplify the testing, building, and deployment of code.

* Cloud Provider: Companies that offer servers for rent and hosting services.

* CD (Continuous Delivery/Deployment)
	- Continuous Delivery: automating the entire software release process
		-- (CI + automatically prepare and track a release to production)
		-- deployment to production is manual
	- Continuous Deployment: every change in the source code is deployed to production automatically
		-- CI + CD + fully automated deployment to production

* CI/CD service runs all tests and deploying the code to production

* CircleCI: used to create a well-documented deployment Pipeline

* Features should be in production when the application has passed a sensible set of pipeline steps with success.

* Manual Check: A step in a pipeline that requires human approval before going to the next step.

* QA (quality assurance)

* EC2: Elastic Compute Cloud

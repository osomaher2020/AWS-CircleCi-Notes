# Production Environment:
	- the complete set of services, where your customer consumes your API.

# Main steps:
	1- Deploy a database using AWS RDS. -- (Relational Database Service) --> hosts the DB
		-- connect from local terminal:
			** psql postgres://osomaher:osomaher123@osomaherdb.c9cgcbjfdejg.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com/osomaherdb
		-- connect the project via .ENV variables
	2- Deploy a web server using AWS EB. -- (Elastic Beanstalk) --> hosts the Web Server [language runtime]
	3- Deploy a web UI using AWS S3. -- (Simple Storage Service) --> hosts files (object-based storage=[filename=filecontent]) [no access to fileSystem]

# CLI: allows for CI/CD pipeline Which can automate operations on the production environment.

# steps to setup a Production Env:
	1- package.json
	2- framework info
	4- external APIs || DBs

* Multi-AZ: (Multiple Availability Zones)
	- your DB can be phisically in multiple data-centers @ independent zones
	** hepls to stay online if one data-center goes down **

* EC2: (Elastic Compute Cloud)
* SNS: (Simple Notification Service)

# ACL policy: (Access Control List) JSON or yml file -> control who can access S3 buckets

# 3-tier full stack application = (UI, API, and DB)

# VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)
